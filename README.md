# NHAN Mapping Contest

_Looking for GIS professionals, mapping hobbyists, and interested learners. We are interested in getting the word out about the current state of New Hampshire Out-of-School time facilities. We have collected data to understand the current population and geographic distribution of students in New Hampshire and the availability of Out-of-School time providers. The Out-of-School time environment is an oppertunity for kids to explore science, technology, engineering, math, physical education, and other topics in a youth lead format. We need your help visualizing this data in an attempt to tell the story of what kids have out there for oppertunities and help drive the future building of this space_
